Psuedo Code:

Load images: a = imread('C://folder1/folder2/path to image');
	- greyscale (1-color channel): colormap(summer)
		imagesc(a) <- scaled image
		Use this for binary images too!
		fi(a) <- custom function that formats the figure window
	-color images (3-color channels) PNG JPG BMP (m x n x 3)
		imshow(a)
		image(a) <- format in uint8 (unsigned 8-bit integers)

crop images: [a, pos] = select(a)
	- fi(a)
	- pos = ginput(2); output two points
	- outputs -> a(pos)

Denoising: denoiseFrame.m
	-filtering by blur
	-fft filtering

turn them to black and white (binary)
	- use an intensity threshold
	- logic statements (a>mean(a(:)))
	- watershed
	- expectation maximization

measure BW images: regionprops.m
	- outputs a structured variable (like a folder)
	- must use . notation, i.e. president.fuchs)

make figures: I like to use structured variables like 'p'
	- field contain data, labels, times, dates, notes
	- make your life convenient
